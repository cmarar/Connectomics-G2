\section{Scientific Question}
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an untreatable neurodegenerative disorder which impairs a person's ability to think, recall memories, and perform basic tasks. Around 5.5 million Americans are estimated to suffer from AD, suggesting that this disease may be the third leading cause of death in the elderly.\cite{Alzheimer's Facts} While treatments are being developed for other neurodegenerative diseases with limited success, there are currently no treatments for AD. As the population ages, AD is becoming an urgent public health issue in need of a solution.
